Next Coin is a modern frontend application for manage and play your arcade games. <br />
It is based on [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org) emulator. With Next Coin you can:

- Manage your romset
- Download metadata and flyers of games
- Create / Export / Import collections
- Add games in your favourites or hide games that you don't want to have
- Access to detailed information about games machines
- Use some builtin shaders
- And obvioulsy RUN YOUR GAMES!!!

## How much is it?
**Next Coin is completely free.**

## What are the supported Platforms?
Next Coin is only available for Windows x64 platform (for now).
However it is a cross platform application under the hood.
It may be released in future also for Unix platforms (MacOS/Linux)

## Why is it on github and i cannot see source code?
Next Coin is a free application but not open source.
Only the binary software is published on github.
I choose to publish binary on github because the application is able to update self automatically every time when a new release version will be uploaded on github server.

## Does the application include games?
No!
